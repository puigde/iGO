Be the fastest with iGO!
<br /> 
## What is iGO?
iGO is a telegram bot that allows you to reach a desired destination in the city of Barcelona in the fastest way possible by car. It does so calculating a time parameter that considers the lenght, maximum speed avaliable during the trip and real time traffic congestion, cool innit?

## How to use iGO:

First of all make sure you fit the specified requirements mentioned in the requirements.txt file. For additional help with installation there are some references at the end of the README, you might want to check them out.

Once the requirements are fullfilled you can download the archives containing the code:
* i_go.py file for the code of the iGO module.
* bot.py file for the code of the iGO telegram bot.

`NOTE:` other files contained in the folder will be generated by your computer so there's no need to download them. The first execution might spend some minutes to get the data files on your computer so the files that don't need to be updated can be loaded.

<br /> 
To use the bot, first of all open your telegram account and add the bot to your chats, you can do so by clicking the following link:

[Start chatting with our bot!](https://t.me/igo_Pol_Jan_bot)

Let's activate the bot, you can execute *bot.py* in the terminal using python3:
```bash
python3 bot.py
```
<br /> 

`NOTE:` if a message pops up saying that the bot is already on it's because the bot is running through another computer, do not worry you can use it anyways! Sadly we currently don't have the resources to keep the bot running 24/7 but it doesn't need a huge amount of resources so you can do it with no worries.

`NOTE:`if you are the first user executing the code you might need to wait a few seconds or even a minute if your computer is slower to let the bot get and arrange the data.

`NOTE:`every five minutes an update is done on the data that the bot is using so if your data got 'old' you might need to wait a few seconds too. 

<br /> 
Now you can start chatting with the bot, type */start* in the chat and the bot will present itself and offer you some help on usage in case you need it. To enable route generation you might want to share your location with the bot so it knows where you are, you can do so with the share location feature that the telegram app has.
<br /> 

`CURRENT BOT FEATURES:`
* /start -> initiates the conversation
* /help -> gets help
* /author -> gets the names of the authors of the bot
* /go <destination> -> shows a map with the fastest route from your location to the indicated destination
* /where -> shows a picture of your current location (the one you shared, this version does not have a 'real time GPS implemented')
  
Wonderful! now that you know how to use the bot you will be the fastest.
